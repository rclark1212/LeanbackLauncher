Leanback Launcher

This really is just a hack hobby project on constructing a leanback launcher example. 

Hacked up from the standard ATV leanback browser sample.

Has a function to have a favorites row.

VERY IMPORTANT:
TO INSTALL:
After installing and running, type
"adb shell pm hide com.google.android.leanbacklauncher"

otherwise leanback will stay as the home launcher.

To bring leanback back...
adb shell pm unhide com.google.android.leanbacklauncher
